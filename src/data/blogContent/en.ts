A morning skincare routine is crucial for protecting your skin throughout the day and achieving a healthy appearance. Here are the steps for an ideal morning routine:

## 1. Cleansing
Gently cleanse oil, sweat, and dead skin cells accumulated overnight. Use a gentle cleanser suitable for your skin type.

## 2. Toner
Apply a toner that regulates skin's pH balance and tightens pores. This step allows better absorption of subsequent products.

## 3. Serum
Antioxidant-rich products like Vitamin C serum are ideal for mornings. They protect your skin from environmental factors and brighten.

## 4. Eye Cream
Moisturize the delicate eye area with a specially formulated eye cream. Effective against puffiness and dark circles.

## 5. Moisturizer
Choose a moisturizer suitable for your skin type. This step maintains skin's moisture balance and provides a smooth appearance.

## 6. Sunscreen (SPF)
The most important step of your morning routine! Always use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30.

## Recommendations
- Always choose products according to your skin type
- Progress from lighter textured products to heavier ones
- Wait 30 seconds between each product
- Be consistent - regular use is essential to see results

# Summer Sun Protection: Everything You Need to Know

Sun protection is the most important skincare step that should be done every day, not just at the beach.

## What is SPF?

SPF (Sun Protection Factor) indicates the product's level of protection against UVB rays.

### SPF Selection
- Daily use: At least SPF 30
- Beach/outdoor activities: SPF 50+
- Sensitive skin: SPF 50+ with physical filters

## Broad Spectrum Protection

Choose products that protect against both UVA and UVB rays:
- **UVA**: Aging, wrinkles, spots
- **UVB**: Burns, redness, skin cancer risk

## Proper Application

### Amount
One teaspoon for face (approximately 2mg/cm²)

### Application Time
15-30 minutes before sun exposure

### Reapplication Frequency
Every 2 hours, definitely after swimming or sweating

## Extra Tips for Summer

1. **Hat and Sunglasses**: Physical protection is also important
2. **Stay in Shade**: Especially between 11:00-16:00
3. **Moisturizing SPF**: Practical and effective
4. **Lip Protection**: Use SPF lip balms
5. **After-Sun Care**: Soothing and repairing products after sun

## Common Mistakes

❌ Applying SPF only to face (don't forget neck, ears, back of hands)
❌ Using insufficient amount
❌ Not using on cloudy days
❌ Forgetting to reapply
❌ Skipping under makeup

## Special Cases

### Acne-Prone Skin
Prefer oil-free, non-comedogenic formulas.

### Sensitive Skin
Use physical filter products (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide).

### Oily Skin
Gel or fluid formulas are ideal.
